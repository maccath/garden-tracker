# Garden Tracker

A garden tracking app, because I wanted to play with Angular.js.

It displays a list of plants and their current statuses, as well as statistics, logs and notes.

Data currently doesn't persist.

## Installation

Simply clone from git, then run `index.html` in your browser of choice.

## Demo

A working demo of the app can be found at http://hako.miggy.org/~katy/garden-tracker
